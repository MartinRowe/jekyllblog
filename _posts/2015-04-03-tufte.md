## Tufte and Design

Tufte’s designs are marvellous.What is it about them? Good typography, negative space, or, to use one of the Braun designers maxims: the absence of design. It is so easy to fall into the trap of adding to an existing design when the ‘trick’ is to subtract, or in the case of the original jekyll design to add, add, add.

So:
1. Good typography
2. Negative space
3. The absence of design
4. Subtract, don’t add
