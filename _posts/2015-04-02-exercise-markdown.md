## Rationale

I could write exercises and answers similar to the C book that did similar. I am a teacher so I know about education. Iâ€™d like to create cutting edge information but I need to concentrate at the same time. The workflow is there: IAWriter, markdown, terminal, github pages, and hosted on github.

There are possibilities:

- CSS Secrets
- A JavaScript framework
- A specific part of CSS - SVG
- Terminal
- Github
- Minimalism
- Negative Space
- Components
- Style Guides

Solve the wicked problems
